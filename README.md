Ticketing
=========

Ticketing (To be later better named.) is designed to be a ticketing or issue
system written in Symfony 3.1.  It takes many influences from various systems
(Ticketing and project management related) used by the author including:
- Redmine
- Bugzilla
- Trac
- Jira
- Basecamp

Eventually this will probably become more than a pet project and actually be an
Open Source project.  Published under MIT license.  Ideally will eventually use differing bundles for things 
to allow component reuse etc.
